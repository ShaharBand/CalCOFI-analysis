# CalCOFI_analysis
This notebook analyzes the CalCOFI dataset using machine learning to find connections between water temperature and salinity.

## Context
The CalCOFI data set represents the longest (1949-present) and most complete (more than 50,000 sampling stations) time series of oceanographic and larval fish data in the world.

It includes abundance data on the larvae of over 250 species of fish larval length frequency data and egg abundance data on key commercial species and oceanographic and plankton data.

The physical, chemical, and biological data collected at regular time and space intervals quickly became valuable for documenting climatic cycles in the California Current and a range of biological responses to them.
